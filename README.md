# To-Do-List

A simple To-Do List that supports the following features:

- A text field is provided should the user want to do anything else apart from "Sleeping, Eating, Coding and reapiting"
  all they have to do is press Enter and the task will be added.
- When a task is done the user can click on it and a line-through effect will take place.
- A Delete button will appear next to the choosen task allowing for swift deletion.

To be added:

- As of right now the list doesn't store the tasks for future use, this functionality will be added in the near future!
